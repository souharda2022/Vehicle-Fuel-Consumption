# Vehicle-Fuel-Consumption
The program in question provides a comprehensive analysis of vehicle types, performance metrics and environmental assessment of vehicles It includes detailed information on vehicle types and characteristics spanning several years around. Key attributes captured in the project include the vehicle make, model, year, class and vehicle type, as well as detailed information on transmission specifications, engine type, and whether the vehicle is equipped with modern technology such as turbochargers including superchargers

The main focus of the project is fuel efficiency and carbon emissions. It includes metrics like miles per gallon, carbon dioxide emissions per mile, and overall fuel economy score in city and highway conditions. For vehicles capable of alternative fuel or hybrid engines, the project provides additional information such as energy consumption, charging time, alternative fuel technologies available

Economically, the project provides insight into annual fuel costs, potential taxes such as the gas guzzler tax, and projected savings or costs over five years based on a fuel consumption model on various. This project is mainly environmental in terms of fuel economy. It is also useful for stakeholders seeking to assess the impact of new modes of transport on sustainable development, and provides a powerful tool for consumers, automotive industry professionals and policy makers to build informed decision making
